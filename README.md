A script which creates animations of different skate tricks. Program will ask for the user's operating system.

__Necessary Applications__

- This software uses ImageMagick 7.0.11 to render GIF of skateboard stunt.
- May also need a (La)Tex compiler to see a quality image of rotational matrix.

The `main.py` script will require the `SkateTrick` class and `matrixModule` script as well. The `main` script will also print the list of stunts defined by software.

This software yields the following:

1. Rotational matrix of the chosen stunt.
2. A GIF of the skateboard trick.
